# Webdev's Guide

This repo *(repository)* provides a roadmap of what you need to know to achieve
a level of proficiency with web-development technologies and stacks.

If you are new to **Open source**, `README.md` is the first file you should read
in any project.

If you want to add something or put something in a better way you're welcome!
Just submit an issue or a pull request, thanks!

Have a question that isn't answered or answer is unclear, submit an issue
on github.

## Philosophy

One should know how to do it from scratch so that you aren't limited by
libraries you use, and can do it by your own if needed.

## Order

Start with beginner levels of following and in given order

-   [HTML](./html.md)
-   [CSS](./css.md)
-   [JS](./js.md)

*Beginner* level stuff is what you **should** know, *intermidiate* stuff is **good** to know and *Advanced* are **great** to know.

These contain features and topics that are most used during our development.

(Coming Soon) Directory `iste_workflow` contains how we do web development at ISTE.


## Sources

There are multiple sources to learn from few quality sources are

Websites
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
- [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)
- [Free Code Camp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/)

Video Tutorials
- [Online Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbwXnUipZsLfUckBPsC7Jog)

## Cheat Code

You don't need to know every thing completely, you just need to know its name
or you just have to know feature you want and then use google `how to do SOMETHING`

## Development Evironment
> You are as good as your tools, because people don't have limits, tools do. 

For beginners we would recomend

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [VS Codium](https://vscodium.com)

[Codium vs Code](https://itsfoss.com/vscodium/)

For delightful experience... **!!STEEP LEARNING CURVE!!**
- [NeoVim](https://neovim.io)

---

**NOTE:** By VS Code we mean Visual Studio **Code** and not visual studio, code
is a cross platform text editor. Visual Studio would be an overkill for web-d.

### Plugins
There are plenty of plugins available for VS code and NeoVim that will prove
to be helpful in development.

For VS code get plugins from `extensions` option in dock on left.
For NeoVim get plugin managers like Vim Plug, Vundle etc. and search for awesome
plugins from [Vim Awesome](https://vimawesome.com).

**Common Pugins**
- VS Code/Codium
	- **Prettier** *beautify code*

- NeoVim
	- [CoC.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) *Code completion*
	- [coc-prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/coc-prettier) *beautify code*
